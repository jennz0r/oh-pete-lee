          <p>Pete Lee is a Taiwanese-born, San Francisco-based director. He started out as a youth worker in the Tenderloin, but shot badass fight scenes and sexy food on the side. Over time, his side gig became his main gig, and he now has to fight to include social work between and during film projects. Through it all, Lee has only increased his fascination with the larger-than-life personalities he has encountered. He obsessively enlists them in music videos, commercials, and short films.</p>
          <p>Lee's directorial work has premiered in Rolling Stone, MTV, NPR, Vice, Comic-Con, and San Francisco International Film Festival amongst other outlets. His photography work has been featured in SF Weekly, Lucky Peach, and Edible Brooklyn amongst other publications.</p>
          <p>Lee recently returned to Asia to collaborate on a cookbook, The Food of Taiwan, published in early 2015. He is currently in post-production for an animated documentary about cancer and rock 'n' roll. He is also conjuring his debut feature film, Don't Be No Hero, about a lonely lady bank robber. Lee enjoys inventing Taiwanese dishes, pretending to know martial arts, and covering Mariah Carey songs.</p>
